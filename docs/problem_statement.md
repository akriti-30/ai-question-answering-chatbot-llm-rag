## Problem Statement

With the rapid growth of digital information, extracting accurate answers from large document collections has become challenging. Conventional chatbots lack contextual understanding and often produce incorrect or irrelevant responses. This project aims to develop an AI-based question answering chatbot using LLM and Retrieval-Augmented Generation to provide reliable and context-aware answers.
