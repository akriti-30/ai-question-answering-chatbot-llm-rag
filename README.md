# AI-Based Question Answering Chatbot using LLM and RAG

## Description
This project implements an AI-based question answering chatbot that provides accurate and context-aware answers to user queries. The system combines a Large Language Model (LLM) with Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) to retrieve relevant information from a knowledge source and generate reliable responses.

## Problem Statement
Traditional chatbots often generate inaccurate or irrelevant responses due to the lack of contextual grounding. There is a need for an intelligent chatbot system that can retrieve domain-specific information and generate accurate answers based on trusted data sources.

## Objectives
- To design and develop an AI-based question answering chatbot.
- To implement Retrieval-Augmented Generation for improved response accuracy.
- To reduce hallucinated responses from language models.
- To provide a simple and user-friendly chatbot interface.

## Technology Stack
- Programming Language: Python  
- Framework: LangChain  
- Language Model: Large Language Model (LLM)  
- Vector Database: FAISS / ChromaDB  
- Interface: Streamlit  
- Version Control: GitHub  

## Project Scope
The chatbot is designed to answer queries related to a specific knowledge domain using the provided data. It focuses on improving accuracy and reliability rather than acting as a general-purpose conversational AI.
